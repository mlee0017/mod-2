The Hyrule Compendium 

This app was inspired by the Nintendo game, Breath of the Wild. Utilizing a public api, I created a react app that would display the individual objects in the game listed in the api. I say objects because the api has categories of monsters, creatures, equipment, materials, and weapons. In the game, the Sheikah Slate is used to take pictures of these objects and helps in searching for them. So since I'm still working on getting hired at Nintendo I just added a searchbar component to the objects page so you can search through to find the object.

Challenges: 
I'll try to keep this section short but it's a lot to unpack. The technical difficulties alone took up most of my time, most of the week I couldn't view the browser after running npm start. Not sure what the issue was with localhost:3000 so I had no idea what I was coding until Thursday and had to start the project on Code Sandbox. I had to update my computer after freeing up 20 GB of storage I'm still a bit in disbelief the amount of time that took. I also thought I had to redownload git because after the update there was an error message I couldn't understand but shoutout to expert googling skills and this link (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52522565/git-is-not-working-after-macos-update-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-pa) for fixing one of my many issues. And this link (https://www.educative.io/answers/the-fatal-refusing-to-merge-unrelated-histories-git-error) for helping me merge the branches because I set that up wrong also.  Aside from the technical and personal obstacles I faced/am facing, this project was fun to create and I look forward to adding more styling to this. This project was created with my tears! Also shoutout to scrimba and my cohort + Hai's office hours for schooling me. And lastly for my computer for not completely giving up on me! (THIS IS WHAT I HAD TO WORK WITH)

Table of Contents: 
Home page - welcome page displaying Hestu dancing 
About page - shows information about the app and its function (also a gif of my mentality during this bootcamp smiling through the pain) 
Objects page - where all the magic happens displaying the objects and the search bar to individually display each object, upon clicking an object it will show the name, description, location, and image

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
